My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My shoe is off, my foot is cold.

My shoe is off, my foot is cold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My hat is old, my teeth are gold.

And now my story is all told.

   -- Dr. Seuss, "One Fish, Two Fish,
                  Red Fish, Blue Fish"
